# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions in Go

Welcome to my repository of solutions for Advent of Code 2023 challenges implemented in Go!

## Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual programming event that takes place in December. Each day, a new programming puzzle is released, and participants are challenged to solve it using their programming skills. The puzzles cover a wide range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques.
